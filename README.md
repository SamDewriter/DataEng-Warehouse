# DataEngineering - Warehouse

This project focuses on creating a scalable data warehouse tech-stack that collects, stores, and transforms a stream of data from sensors, and analyse the data to provide key insights to the business. 
The data used in this project is obtained from https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~clarkf/ and is stored in a MySQL database. The database is then connected to dbt(data build tool) that allows seamless transformation of the collected data.
